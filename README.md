# Get-Started-with-Basys-3-Board
This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to creating a simple FPGA project on the Basys 3 board using Vivado Xilinx. The project involves implementing an AND gate in SystemVerilog, connecting it to two switches, and controlling the state of an LED based on the switch inputs.

Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

Vivado Design Suite
Basys 3 FPGA board
Basic understanding of FPGA programming and Vivado tools
Project Components
SystemVerilog Implementation: The project will include the SystemVerilog code for an AND gate, encapsulated within a module.

Simulation: A simulation file will be created to verify the functionality of the AND gate design.

Bitstream Generation: Instructions will be provided for generating the bitstream that will be loaded onto the Basys 3 board.

Constraints: Constraint files (.xdc) will be generated to specify the I/O connections and timing constraints for the design.

# Get-Started-with-Basys-3-Board
This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to creating a simple FPGA project on the Basys 3 board using Vivado Xilinx. The project involves implementing an AND gate in SystemVerilog, connecting it to two switches, and controlling the state of an LED based on the switch inputs.
